- Handle 100+ concurrent file operations
- Storage backend agnostic (local, S3, Azure, GCS)
- Horizontal scaling capability

### Security Requirements
- All file operations require authentication
- File-level access control
- Audit logging for all operations
- Secure file URLs with expiration

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Large file handling**: Implement streaming uploads/downloads
2. **Storage costs**: Add file lifecycle management
3. **Performance**: Implement caching and CDN integration
4. **Data consistency**: Use database transactions and validation

### Operational Risks
1. **Storage migration**: Create migration tools and procedures
2. **Backup and recovery**: Implement automated backup strategies
3. **Monitoring**: Add comprehensive logging and alerting
4. **Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date documentation
