"""
Request context and access logging.

Phase 0 of the RBAC rollout (docs/RBAC.md) needs an inventory of who calls the
routes that currently have no authentication, before any of them start returning
401. There was no request logging at all -- only CORSMiddleware was registered --
so there was no way to answer "which open routes receive anonymous traffic, from
which clients and source addresses".

This middleware emits one structured line per request carrying the request id,
the claimed principal, how it authenticated, the route, the status and the
duration.

Deliberately performs NO database queries. Identity is taken from the credential
itself: a bearer JWT is decoded locally for its `sub` claim, and an API key
contributes only its non-secret prefix. Adding a lookup here would double the
authentication queries on every authenticated request, and this phase changes no
behaviour -- it only observes.

Consequently the principal recorded is CLAIMED, not validated: a request bearing
an expired or revoked token still reports its subject. For inventory purposes
that is the more useful reading, since a caller presenting a stale token is
exactly the kind of consumer that needs finding before endpoints close. The
`auth_valid` field distinguishes the two.
